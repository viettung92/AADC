git submodule update --init
make

python server2.py (have a video in place!)
OR python server.py (have a ar drone connected)

./client2 [--no-oculus]




Design is as follows:

	server.py connects to your Parrot AR.Drone 2.0, and lets you control
	it with your gamepad.
	client2 connects to that server.py and does the graphic stuff.

	This has the advantage that your client can crash and you don't lose
	control of the copter
